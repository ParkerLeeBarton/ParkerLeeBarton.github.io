I competed on the Iron Eagles team for four years, serving as team captain all four, leading mechanical design, programming, CAD, and notebooking. We won 50+ awards, 8 Signature Events, and made World Championship Division Finals twice.</p>
                        <p>Beyond competition, I helped form what became the most successful alliance in VEX and built a worldwide network of top teams to collaborate on ideas and strategy. I kept a notebook every season in detail and shared content through YouTube (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@parkerleebarton" target="_blank">Parker Barton</a>). Across four years, my goal was to build the innovative and competitive robots that set the benchmark for competition. </p>

                        <p>For our Worlds design, we carried over the same swappable system from Charles. The difference was that we could also choose to run neither mechanism. If we removed both the flywheel and launcher, the robot became similar to our first robot, Hank, and used the “bowling technique” instead. This version had one big advantage, it could fit below 6 inches, which let us descore freely. That flexibility gave us multiple strategic options depending on the match.</p>

                        <p>Charles was a similar design to Katie Ann, but we focused on refining it. We improved our barrier crossing and continued developing the shooter and lift (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/LdwjxVyuDWM" target="_blank">here is a prototype</a>). One of the bigger changes was experimenting with a modular system that let us swap between a slip launcher and a flywheel, trading speed for consistency depending on strategy. The robot was very successful, winning two signature events and even landing us on the local news.</p>

                        <p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q95a-o5AVBo" target="_blank">robot design</a> caught a lot of teams off guard. Most teams were using blockers to stop shots from matchloaders, but instead of trying to work around the blockers, we raised the height of our shooter using a lift. That adjustment gave us much better control over ball placement and opened up scoring options other teams didn’t have. The robot went on to win five tournaments, including a signature event, and the design quickly spread throughout the competition. It ended up becoming one of the more influential builds of that season.</p>

                        <p>Our first robot of the season was ahead of its time. Most robots at that point in the season depended on launchers to move balls from the matchloader. We had a different idea, we called it bowling, we would place balls into our robot and push them across in large quantities. While we still were first seed at Mall of America the design proved to be ineffective at that point in the season. The strategy however became very prominent later at the end of the season, giving us a headstart. Here is a early teaser I made showing its "oneshot" capabilities: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/HHKfmjvuSRo" target="_blank">Video</a>.</p>

                        <p>The worlds robot was designed to be a high performing and reliable robot that did not significantly alter our stratgy or what we knew worked. The largest change was the introduction of a 3rd wheel mechanism that could rotate rollers no matter the direction of the robot.

We kept a bound sheet of mesh tucked into the robot that, when actuated, deployed into a 2ft square blocker. It could deflect endgame strings to limit points or push opponents’ strings out of the field, causing disqualifications. This mechanism is largely credited with winning the Canadian Open and making finals at the Kalahari Classic, where every opponent we faced in eliminations was disqualified because of it.</p>

                        <p> With the design of the MK3 I began introducing custom delrin that we laser cut at our lab. This allowed us to introduce tight fitting and complex mechanisms. One of which was a ratcheting mechanism that would switch between a catapult and an intake. We used small custom cut ratcheting gears as well as slip gears that intentionally had missing teeth. This gave us a competitive advantage, allowing us to draw our catapult back quicker to reload. </p>

We added more height to the launcher to expand our scoring range and changed the intake from a static roller to a “bobbing” roller that could flex under load and recover cleaner. The changes weren’t flashy, but they made the whole system smoother and more reliable. The robot ended up performing at a high level, winning two signature events, and playing in the finals of two others. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osTvpbb53aI" target="_blank">Match Video</a></p>

                        <p>The first Signature event of the season at Mall of America launched our team forward after winning. At that point I had finished building the robot several weeks before the tournament, giving a substantial amount of time to spend on programing and strategy. I used the time to develop my programming skills making use of the vision sensor to track the goals location and the color of the rollers. Another standout feature of this robot was the “blooper” . What started as a small piece of scrap metal became a pivotal part that every robot had once we unveiled it.

                        <p>That season, we were the first team to really popularize a PTO (power takeoff) system in VEX. The mechanism worked by shifting gears linearly to transfer power from one system to another, letting us drive and operate another mechanism off the same motors. The system was very effective and led to us becoming the first Tennessee team to win a signature event. With the reputation I had gained over the course of the season me and another member of my team formed the WhyNot alliance, now considered the most successful alliance to ever exist. </p>

                        <p>After my first year, things started to change. This was the first robot I worked on that actually used CAD, and it completely changed how I approached design. I began documenting everything and keeping track of what top teams around the world were building. I also started building a network of people across the country to talk ideas through and learn from. </p>

                    <p>My first year competing in robotics was mostly spent learning the basics. I was on the freshmen team, 9364G, with a team of 7 people. Nobody else really did much, so it pushed me to figure everything out myself. I ended up learning how to build and taught myself how to code too. The robots were pretty bad. We built three robots that year (Figures 1–3), and each one was just another attempt to make something that worked a little better than the last. Even though they weren’t impressive, we still managed to win a small tournament. That year set the foundation for everything that came after.</p>
