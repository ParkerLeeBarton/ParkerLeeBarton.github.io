                        <p>The <a href="https://purduesigbots.com/" target="_blank">Purdue SigBots</a> is a highly respected 70+ member interdisciplinary competitive robotics team. Aside from their impressive competitive track record, they are also responsible for creating public resources such as the <a href="https://wiki.purduesigbots.com/" target="_blank">VEX Wiki</a>, and the <a href="https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/" target="_blank">PROS</a> operating system. The Sigbots fall under the umbrella organization <a href="https://acm.cs.purdue.edu/" target="_blank">(ACM) Association for Computing Machinery</a>.</p>
                        <p>As the vice president of ACM and the mechanics lead of the SigBots, I oversee organizational leadership, financials, team structure, and manufacturing. Additionally, I lead mechanical design efforts for the 24” BLRS2 robot using Autodesk Inventor. I manage a $40,000 budget, secure industry sponsorships, and structure recruit workshops to scale technical proficiency in CAD, manufacturing, and notebooking for over 30 new members annually.</p>

                        <p>The Purdue Sigbots has had the lab space in the basement of HAAS hall for over 15 years. Through that time the lab has had no major remodeling or repairs. There was no clear storage system, the walls were corroded and moldy, and we were running out of space.</p>
                        <p>As a result I spearheaded a renovation of the Purdue Sigbots lab by removing outdated equipment, repairing and painting walls, and installing upgraded storage including shelves, cupboards, and large drawers. To raise funds I acquired sponsorships and donations. The plan was put together in CAD with Fusion 360 and budgeted in Excel. </p>

                    <p>To bring in a source of income, we host two to three high school robotics competitions each year. We also host the largest VEXU competition, aside from worlds, in the world.

Part of my job as the mechanics lead I am responsible for designing and fabricating the trophies awarded at these competitions.</p>
