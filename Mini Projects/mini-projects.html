I used mine as a chance to go further and experiment with anodization, applying what I had been learning about surface prep, current control, and process consistency. After a lot of trial and error on earlier projects, this was the first time everything came together easily.</p>

                        <p>To take it a step further, I designed and 3D printed a custom case for it and added a thin polycarbonate front cover. It’s simple, but it’s something I use every day in my room, a small project that's practical. </p>

                        <p>During my freshman year at Purdue, I started messing around with small clip on accessories made specifically for the standard dorm furniture, lofted beds, desks, shelves, all of it. I went through a bunch of different hook designs trying to get the snap fit just right so it would be solid but not damage anything. I was constantly tweaking clearances and print orientation to make them stronger and less likely to crack. What started as something just for my own room slowly turned into a full lineup of dorm specific attachments.</p>

                        <p>I also made practical stuff like a skateboard holder for when it’s wet out, cup holders, and small containers for bathroom storage. Everything was designed in CAD and printed in batches in my dorm. People kept asking for them, and I ended up selling a lot of the furniture-mounted ones around campus. It was honestly just me solving problems I had, but it turned into a small side business and a really good lesson in designing something people actually want to use.</p>

                        <p>My roommates and I designed and built a custom cat post from scratch after one of us got a cat. We modeled it in CAD first to plan dimensions and structure, then used saws and basic shop tools to cut and assemble everything. It’s a multi-level setup sized for our space and sturdy enough to hold up over time. We designed the frame to fit a replaceable scratch pad and made sure it was stable and easy to move. It was a simple project, but a good mix of planning and hands on building.</p>

                        <p>I designed a fully parametric robotic hand entirely in CAD. The model is driven by a few key measurements, like fingertip size, and everything else scales automatically. I used configurations to reduce part files and keep the assembly clean and flexible. The hand is fully jointed and animated, with a string-pull tendon system that could be connected to servos. The main goal was flexibility, both in movement and in how easily the design can adapt to different sizes. I might decide to continue into fabrication in the future. </p>

It mounts between the deck and trucks and has a hidden cavity that fits an AirTag inside. I also designed and cut my own custom “Boiler Up” grip tape purely for the aesthetic. Nothing performance related there, I just wanted it to look cool.</p>

The original image was faded and corroded, so I researched historical references and recreated the crest digitally in CAD, preserving the key symbols and design styles. From there, I laser cut the crest into keychains and other small memorabilia as gifts for my family. It was a mix of research, CAD, and fabrication, turning a fragile old artifact into something tangible.</p>
